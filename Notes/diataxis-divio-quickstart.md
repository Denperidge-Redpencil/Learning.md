# Divio Docs Quickstart
An attempt at boiling down the amazing [30min talk/documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/) on how to write better documentation into something unobtrusive enough for people familiar with it to use as a checklist, but instructive enough for people unfamiliar with it to somewhat do the thing.

## Does your documentation include...

### Tutorials
For each tutorial: write as if you're *teaching a child how to cook*.

Checklist:

- [ ] Holds the readers hand from start to finish
- [ ] Gives a sense of achievement
- [ ] Works for everyone, with minimal explanation
- [ ] Also teaches what ***you*** take for granted

### How-To's?
For each how-to: write down how to achieve **1** specific thing as if it were a *cooking recipe*.

Checklist:

- [ ] Only 1 practical goal per how-to
- [ ] Minimal explanation
- [ ] Flexible: works for different but similar uses 


### References?
For each reference: write as if you are writing an *encyclopedia* article.

Checklist:

- [ ] Structured like the codebase
- [ ] Doesn't [explain common tasks](#how-tos)
- [ ] Doesn't [explain basic concepts](#tutorials)
- [ ] Fully describes the machinery

### Discussions/background material
For each background material: write as if you're writing about the *history and context* of a subject.

Checklist:

- [ ] Explains design decisions
- [ ] Considers alternatives
- [ ] Helps the reader make sense of things
