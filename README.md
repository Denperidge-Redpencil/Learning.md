# Denperidge's Learning.md
I'm learning new languages and frameworks! So I'm keeping notes on the things I've learned so I can have that to look back upon because memory and stuff.

There's a [repo](https://github.com/Denperidge/Learning.md) in case you want to contribute, or view it on [GitHub Pages](https://denperidge.github.io/Learning.md/)!

## Notes
- [Diataxis/Divio documentation guidelines](Notes/diataxis-divio-quickstart.md)
- [SPARQL](Notes/sparql.md)
- [Ember.js](Notes/emberjs.md)

### Other notes/shadow realm
I also have additional notes, which are notes that I've mainly written down for myself because I don't understand them well enough (yet) to integrate them in the original. So be warned!
